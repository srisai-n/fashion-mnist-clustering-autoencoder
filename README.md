# fashion-mnist-clustering-autoencoder
Unsupervised Learning for Cluster Analysis of Fashion-MNIST Images

**Summary**
- clustered images of fashion apparel using two algorithms: K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models.
- autoencoders (neural network-based dimensionality reduction technique) are used to speed up the computations.
- used Python, Keras, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- part of the course 'CSE 574 - Introduction to Machine Learning' at University at Buffalo, SUNY
